# Product Vision

For the player who wants a game that adapts itself to their needs, this product is a 2D dungeon crawler that leads to a unique experience for each person.
Unlike the traditional dungeon crawler that either uses pre made levels, or purely random ones, our product uses an emergent AI that generates levels based on the playstyle of the user.
