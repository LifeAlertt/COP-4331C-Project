# Product Vision

For the player who wants a game that can be continously challenging and replayable, the product is a 2D dungeon crawler that offers a unique experience for each person by adapting to their needs.
Unlike the traditional dungeon crawler that uses either pre-made or purely random levels, our product offers continous content through the use of an emergent AI that keeps track of the player's decisions and playstyle.
