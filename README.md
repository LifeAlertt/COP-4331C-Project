# Product Vision

For the player who wants a game that can be continously challenging and replayable, this product is a 2D dungeon crawler that offers a unique experience for each person by adapting to their needs.
Unlike the traditional dungeon crawler that uses either pre-made or purely random levels, our product uses an emergent AI that keeps track of the player's decisions and playstyle to generate new levels and content appropriately.
